**Classes I coded**
- Main (with Sophia)
- MenuItem (with Sophia)
- BubbleTea
- Pizza

**Which file to check for commenting and documentation**
- Pizza class OR
- Main class (pizza and bubble tea ordering sections. there are many, many separate methods used to organize the process. The Main class also has a lot more code than Pizza).

**How did you demonstrate modular programming?**
- Main method (pizza and bubble tea ordering sections).
- I split up the ordering process into different methods (ex: one for ordering bbt flavour, one of bbt size, bbt topping, bbt ice, etc etc).
- and one method that puts all the bbt ordering together. in the main method, only one method is called to start the process of bbt ordering. (only three lines of code: two for the if block, one to call the orderBubbleTea() method)
- all said for BubbleTea is same for Pizza.

**How did you demonstrate use of AGILE?**
- had a daily work log: https://docs.google.com/document/d/11JdQFVmyFg2MQKmp1E77993SFYWQ427F/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114611880958326196442&rtpof=true&sd=true
- created google docs for each class I created (Pizza and BubbleTea).
