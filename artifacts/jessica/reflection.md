**What knowledge and/or skills did you learn?**
In Java, I did not necessarily learn anything new, but I did brush up on my old skills! It was definitely needed too. Does that count as relearning? Anyway! File IO was the biggest aspect of this; everything else was something I learned this year or only had to do a very brief recap. There were some classes in our program that used “outside-of-class” learned stuff (see: DisplayImage.java, image attached below)

This class uses the javax package, but Sophia coded it not me. (AKA: she learned this, not me). I must mention that even though I did not learn it for this class, I still understand what is happening! I tried playing around with this stuff outside of class.

This was a group project, and as always, collaboration is also a high priority. To me, it all boils down to who I partner with. (Sophia has been very great!). However, GitHub was a bit of an issue. Especially with possible code being overridden (I talk about this in the next section), there were a few precautions that had to be taken. Other issues like time management were not an issue for me, except for near the end where I had a bajillion tests and assessments due.

**What problems did you experience?**
My biggest problems came from GitHub, not from any code logic! I pushed my work onto a new branch (not main), and then pulled and merged it to the main. Along the way, a bit of my code was overridden and I had to rewrite it. The problem was not too hard to fix, as I already had all the logic in my head. All I had to do was reprogram the code.

Not much of a code problem, but an organizational obstacle that I came across: in the Main class, all of the ordering code was written in the main method. At the start, it was simple and short enough to feel okay to read without getting a headache. Once I added my two foods (pizza and bubble tea), it became a lot harder to understand what was going on with all the if statements and commenting.

To solve this problem, I created different ordering methods for each section of food. (I don’t think section is the right word). For example, when the user orders bubble tea, the first thing asked is “What flavour you want?”. The user inputs what they want, and then ‘flavour = input’. However, we had to make sure that the input was an option that we gave (original, mango, taro, etc.). I did this with an if statement nested in a do while loop. This by itself took 20 or so lines of code, and you can imagine how quickly that stacks up when the user has to input 5 more things (size, topping, sugar level, etc.). With different methods separately performing each of these tasks, it was much easier to visually see what was going on in my code.

**Key: show your learning that isn’t shown explicitly through the code.**
I learned about GitHub! I know we had our small assignment on it beforehand, but for me it was “all talk and no walk”. I could talk about what a branch or a pull or a merge was, but performing it with my real code was a lot scarier. I did that (with a few failures) but in the end it was worth it because I actually learned! 

I enjoy organization, and so learning + developing my organization skills has been pretty fun along the way. From planning my time out (semi)wisely to well-written code to class documentation, it has been a good experience.
